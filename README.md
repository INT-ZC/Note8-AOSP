# Note8-AOSP To do & Info
# Looking for devs with Galaxy S8/+ or Note8 to help! If You want to help just message @protodevnan0 on Telegram! :)

Source should be complete by now. Updated a lot of files. It should get to the building with ninja point, but unfortunately my PC is cr*p and it crashes :(

Everyone is welcome to use it, modify it, fork it, anything. You have all my permission. 

Just add kernel source(knoxless, encryptionless) and it should be ready to build. 

Source updated on: 09-10-2017

HUGE THANKS TO FEVAX AND JESEC AND OTHER S7 AOSP DEVS FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE! YOU CAN THANK THEM BY DONATING!
